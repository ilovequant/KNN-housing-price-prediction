# KNN-housing-price-prediction

The purpose of this project is to predict the housing price with the data of nearby houses. Therefore, a Gaussian-kernel based KNN algorithm was
implemented. Additionally, an inverse kernel and average kernel were also integrated to compare to the performance of the Gaussian-kernel. The performance was gauged with root median square error(RMSE). The effects of different types of kernels as well as the value of k have been evaluated based on the code.
